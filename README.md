## 👋 Hi, I'm Arkan (2kfi)

Old-school values, relentless curiosity, and a taste for bending tech to my will. I build homelabs out of scrap like a cyberpunk engineer in a thrift store—turning Atom CPUs into fortress-grade servers. My mind drifts between physics, psychology, and “what if” scenarios, but I lock down on practical, hands-on setups.

- 🎒 16-year-old student from Al-Karak, Jordan
- 🖥️ Tinkerer, homelabber, and “what-if” overthinker
- 🛠️ Passionate about reviving couch/LAN multiplayer for low-spec machines—championing split-screen and 1GB RAM-friendly fun
- 👑 Run a tiny army of Atom mini-PCs (three of them)
- 🎨 Find beauty in simplicity, but make it run like clockwork
- 🧬 Interests: tech, engineering, psychology, biology (cells, bacteria, viruses), math, sci-fi, romance novels, and anime
- 💻 Bilingual: Arabic 🇯🇴 & English 🇺🇸 | OS: Arch Linux, Ubuntu, FreeBSD & Windows
- 📷 Self-hosting, networking, and tinkering with old tech are my jam
- 🗝️ Carrying a sense of legacy—want what I build to last beyond me
